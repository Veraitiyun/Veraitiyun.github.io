When it comes to storing pictures, Wallpapers is the best way to go. Not only are they easy and quick to access, but they can also be stored in a way that is convenient for you. Here are five tips on how to store wallpapers:
1) Choose the right size: When deciding how much wallpaper to store, it’s important to take into account the space you have and the type of wallpaper you’re interested in. If your wallspace is small, try choosing a smaller wallpaper rather than a large one.

2) Use media organizers: When organizing your wallpaper collection, using media organizers can make life so much easier. For example, if you keep all your photos on individual albums, then each album will have its own organizer.

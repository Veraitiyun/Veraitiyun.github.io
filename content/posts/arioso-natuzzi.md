When it comes to wallpaper, there are a few things that you need to take into account before making your decision. The first and most important factor is the size of your room. A wallpaper with a large image will not fit well in a small room, and vice versa. 
The second thing that you need to consider is the color of your home's walls. If you want a wallpapers to be noticed, you'll want to choose something that complements your home's natural colors. However, if your walls are light brown or white, then a darker color may work better. 
Lastly, the quality of the wallpaper should be considered. Some people find that prints or photos will not show as well on high-quality wallpaper than others.

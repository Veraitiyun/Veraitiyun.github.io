Recommendations for watching anime: You can
Recommendations for watching anime you can. There are many different types of anime that can be enjoyed, so it really depends on what you're looking for in an anime. While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime: 
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching. 
-If you're looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA's or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.

The History of Anime: From Manga to Animation
Anime has been around since the late 1800s, and its history is nothing short ofLegend. Today, there are millions of fans across the globe who enjoy watching anime on TV or streaming services. While some may only be familiar with Japan's popular genre, others may have never heard of Studio Ghibli, creators of Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. Here are five key moments in the history of anime that will leave you wondering why it continues to grow in popularity today:
1) In 1907, Japans born artist and illustrator Eisuke Matsubara drew the first manga-style animation for a film release. This was followed by many other studios throughout the 1930s and 1940s before Production I.G began releasing anime films in earnest in 1954.
